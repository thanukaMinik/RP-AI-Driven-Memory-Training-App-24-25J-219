# System Overview
AI Driven Memory Training App is an web application designed to support individuals who have a risk of having memory disorders like Parkinson, Alzheimer's etc. It offers four key features:

**Symptom Detection Engine**

• The Symptom Detection Engine is designed to enhance the early diagnosis and ongoing management of neurological disorders.

**AI Driven Dynamic Content Generation**

• AI-driven dynamic content generation plays a crucial role in personalizing user experiences and give content to meet the unique needs of each user, enhancing engagement and effectiveness in managing neurological disorders.

**Creating Memory training activities using Natural Language Processing**

• NLP enhances cognitive functions in users to provide personalized, adaptive training for thier ongoing memory training by focussing on the core features including Interactive story telling, Conversational recall, Word association

**Gamification Memory Training**

• Gamified memory training uses game-like features to make the training more engaging and motivating. It includes rewards, progress tracking, feedback, and easy-to-use designs to keep users interested and committed for a long time
